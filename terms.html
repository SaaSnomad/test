                                SaaSNomad is not involved in the transaction process of selling or buying any company. The parties selling and buying company must engage in their own Due Diligence to assure the validity of any transaction. Sellers and Purchasers should consult an attorney and/or an accountant before entering into any transaction. SaaSNomad does not provide any legal or tax advice.
                            </p>

                                Fees are paid when seller decides to answer the buyer's contact request. Payment of the Fee is due and payable within 14 days by credit card or Paypal. The Seller permits SaaSNomad to automatically deduct the fee from credit card or Paypal in the event the fee is 14 days or more overdue. Our intermediary services begin once payment has been received. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
